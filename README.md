# Mission

Everyone wants to extend the life of **Rick and Morty** for as long as possible, and everyone wants to see new seasons as soon as possible! We have a plan. The first step that we have taken upon ourselves is to create the **Flurbo** currency and send a **1,000,000,000 FLB** donation to **Dan Harmon** and **Justin Roiland**. The second and most important step is entirely up to you. "How can I help?" you ask? Just become a part of the **Flurbo community** and help it grow! Let's make Flurbo great! Rikki-tikki-tavi, bitch! Remember, it's all up to you and that's the waaaayyy the news goes! AIDS!

# How to start use Flurbo?

You can download Linux or Windows binaries of "**Flurbo Wallet**" CLI or GUI from [Flurbo Download Page](http://flurbo.cc/#download) and that's why I always say "Shumshumschilpiddydah!".

## Supporting the project

Flurbo is a 100% community-sponsored endeavor. If you want to join our efforts and help "The Flurbo Project" to grow, the easiest thing you can do is support the project financially. All funds received will go to promote Flurbo, make higher it's exchange rate and to pay all of necessary things, like seed nodes, so if you make decision to send donation please write message to [@iMrPoopybutthole](https://t.me/iMrPoopybutthole) after that and you will be rewarded! You can use next Bitcoin address for donation:

# Compiling Flurbo from source

The following table summarizes the tools and libraries required to build. By default, the build uses the library installed on the system, and ignores the vendored sources. However, if no library is found installed on the system, then the vendored source will be built and used. The vendored sources are also used for statically-linked builds because distribution packages often include only shared library binaries (.so) but not static library archives (.a).

## Build instructions

Flurbo uses the CMake build system and a top-level [Makefile](Makefile)
that invokes cmake commands as needed.

### On Linux and OS X

* Install the dependencies
* Change to the root of the source code directory and build:
```
cd flurbo
make
```
* The resulting executables can be found in "build/release/bin"
* Add PATH="$PATH:$HOME/flurbo/build/release/bin" to ".profile"
* Run Flurbo with "flurbod --detach"
* **Optional**: build and run the test suite to verify the binaries:
```
make release-test
```
*NOTE*: "core_tests" test may take a few hours to complete.
* **Optional**: to build binaries suitable for debugging:
```
make debug
```
* **Optional**: to build statically-linked binaries:
```
make release-static
```
* **Optional**: build documentation in "doc/html" (omit "HAVE_DOT=YES" if "graphviz" is not installed):
```
HAVE_DOT=YES doxygen Doxyfile
```
### On Windows:

Binaries for Windows are built on Windows using the MinGW toolchain within
[MSYS2 environment](http://msys2.github.io). The MSYS2 environment emulates a
POSIX system. The toolchain runs within the environment and *cross-compiles*
binaries that can run outside of the environment as a regular Windows
application.

**Preparing the build environment**

* Download and install the [MSYS2 installer](http://msys2.github.io), either the 64-bit or the 32-bit package, depending on your system.
* Open the MSYS shell via the `MSYS2 Shell` shortcut
* Update packages using pacman:  
```
pacman -Syuu  
```
* Exit the MSYS shell using Alt+F4  
* Edit the properties for the "MSYS2 Shell" shortcut changing "msys2_shell.bat" to "msys2_shell.cmd -mingw64" for 64-bit builds or "msys2_shell.cmd -mingw32" for 32-bit builds
* Restart MSYS shell via modified shortcut and update packages again using pacman:  
```
pacman -Syuu  
```
* Install dependencies:
  To build for 64-bit Windows:
```
# To build for 64-bit Window
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain make mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-boost mingw-w64-x86_64-openssl mingw-w64-x86_64-zeromq mingw-w64-x86_64-libsodium

#To build for 32-bit Windows:
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-toolchain make mingw-w64-i686-cmake mingw-w64-i686-boost mingw-w64-i686-openssl mingw-w64-i686-zeromq mingw-w64-i686-libsodium
```
* Open the MingW shell via "MinGW-w64-Win64 Shell" shortcut on 64-bit Windows
  or "MinGW-w64-Win64 Shell" shortcut on 32-bit Windows. Note that if you are
  running 64-bit Windows, you will have both 64-bit and 32-bit MinGW shells.

**Building**

* If you are on a 64-bit system, run:
```
make release-static-win64
```
* If you are on a 32-bit system, run:
```
make release-static-win32
```
* The resulting executables can be found in "build/release/bin"

#### Building portable statically linked binaries

By default, in either dynamically or statically linked builds, binaries target the specific host processor on which the build happens and are not portable to other processors. Portable binaries can be built using the following targets:
```
make release-static-linux-x86_64 - builds binaries on Linux on x86_64 portable across POSIX systems on x86_64 processors
make release-static-linux-i686 - builds binaries on Linux on x86_64 or i686 portable across POSIX systems on i686 processors
make release-static-linux-armv8 - builds binaries on Linux portable across POSIX systems on armv8 processors
make release-static-linux-armv7 - builds binaries on Linux portable across POSIX systems on armv7 processors
make release-static-linux-armv6 - builds binaries on Linux portable across POSIX systems on armv6 processors
make release-static-win64 - builds binaries on 64-bit Windows portable across 64-bit Windows systems
make release-static-win32 - builds binaries on 64-bit or 32-bit Windows portable across 32-bit Windows systems
```

## Running flurbod

The build places the binary in "bin/" sub-directory within the build directory
from which cmake was invoked (repository root by default). To run in
foreground:
```
./bin/flurbod
```
To list all available options, run "./bin/flurbod --help".  Options can be
specified either on the command line or in a configuration file passed by the
"--config-file" argument.  To specify an option in the configuration file, add
a line with the syntax "argumentname=value", where "argumentname" is the name
of the argument without the leading dashes, for example "log-level=1".

To run in background:
```
./bin/flurbod --log-file flurbod.log --detach
```
To run as a systemd service, copy
[flurbod.service](utils/systemd/flurbod.service) to "/etc/systemd/system/" and
[flurbod.conf](utils/conf/flurbod.conf) to "/etc/". The [example
service](utils/systemd/flurbod.service) assumes that the user "flurbo" exists
and its home is the data directory specified in the [example
config](utils/conf/flurbod.conf).

After operation will be complete you can start using Flurbo by running this files:
* **flurbod** - Flurbo Blockchain Synchronization Daemon (this file you will need to run first, before flurbo-wallet-cli).
* **flurbo-wallet-cli** - Flurbo Wallet Application (this file you will need to run second, right after flurbod will start synchronization with blockchain network).

~ That's all, bitches! ~
